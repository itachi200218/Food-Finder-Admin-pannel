→ Gemini AI generates a complete recipe and saves it to MySQL

"delete recipe Veg Fried Rice category 1"
→ Gemini AI parses the request, validates it, and deletes the record


#### 🧩 Additional AI Features
- Multi-language code generation (Java, Python, JavaScript)  
- Automatic database structure documentation  
- Excel-ready analytics export  
- Query intent detection using Redis cache  
- Human-like responses for admin interactions
